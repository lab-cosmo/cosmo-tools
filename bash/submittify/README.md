A script to prepare papers for submission
=========================================

Several journals have annoying requirements for submission 
(e.g. incorporated bibliography, remove comments, figures renamed
to fig*.*).

Usage:
Before running you need to compile fully your project to PDF, e.g.

```
$ pdflatex filename.tex; bibtex filename; pdflatex filename.tex
```

then you create a folder that will hold the submission, e.g. 

```
$ mkdir submit
```

you can then run the script as

```
$ submittify.sh filename submit/
```
